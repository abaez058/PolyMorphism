## 📘 Overview  
**PolyMorphism** is a small Java project that illustrates the concept of *polymorphism* in object-oriented programming (OOP).  
It defines a base class `Employee`, and derived classes such as `Manager` and `Clerk`.  
A `Main` class demonstrates how you can treat different employee types uniformly while still invoking their unique behaviors.  

> **Concept:** One interface, many forms.

## ✨ Features  
- Inheritance: `Manager` and `Clerk` extend `Employee`.  
- Method overriding: each subclass provides its own implementation.  
- Runtime polymorphism: `Employee` references can hold subclass objects.  
- Simple and easy-to-understand example for learning OOP fundamentals.
